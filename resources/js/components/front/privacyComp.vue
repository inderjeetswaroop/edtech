                                    Stage 1: Mediation. In case of a dispute, the matter will first be attempted to be resolved by a sole mediator who is a neutral third party and will be selected at the mutual acceptance of a proposed mediator by both parties. Both parties may raise a name for the sole mediator and in case both parties accept the proposed name, the said person shall be appointed as sole mediator. In any case, the parties are not able to reach a consensus within two proposed mediators, the Institute reserves the right to decide who the final mediator is. The decision of the mediator is not binding on both parties, however, the parties in good faith will attempt to bind by the decision which will be in the form of a settlement agreement signed by both parties and duly endorsed by the mediator for having mediated that settlement.
