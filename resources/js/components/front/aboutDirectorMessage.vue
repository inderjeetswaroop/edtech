                                    There is no alternative to this administrative system. The Union will go, you will not have a united India if you do not have a good All-India Service which has the independence to speak out its mind, which has the sense of security that you will stand by your work. If you do not adopt this course, then do not follow the present Constitution, substitute something else these people are the instrument. Remove them and I see nothing but a picture of chaos all over the country.

                            No one else can create your future for you other than yourself. For being focused and not just groping in the dark you need a teacher, mentor, guide and motivator, who would not only prepare you for this challenge with his example of success and experience of unique nature having conquered the summit in his first and the only attempt in perhaps one of the most difficult examination in the country. That is precisely we at Be N By IAS, with the most personal and meaningful message “Be an IAS /By an IAS”, are striving to provide every aspirant with an opportunity to get taught, trained and prepared for accomplishing this herculean task in the shortest possible time with highest standards of quality inputs. However, this can be made possible by none other than the aspirants themselves with the devotion, hard work and a strong zeal for accomplishing the achievable. One can get ‘coaching’ from umpteen good teachers but the difference is made when they can get moulded through structured guidance by someone with years of real success and experience and become a role model himself.

                             I would never like to see the aspirants keep on waiting for tomorrow to get onto the path of success and would rather be honoured to give my country as many excellent civil servants as I can during my lifetime through my motivation and guidance. So wake up and make a call by truly following this beautiful message:
