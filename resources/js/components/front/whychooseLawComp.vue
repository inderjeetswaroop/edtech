                                        That's why choosing an Optional Subject wisely becomes imperative. This choice of Optional is from the 26 optional subjects offered by the Union Public Service Commission. Getting one's name in the final merit list largely depends upon one's performance in their Optional as the marks obtained by other candidates in Essay and G.S Papers are almost in the same range and marks obtained in their Optional Subject play a crucial role in deciding whether they reach the next and final stage, i.e., Personality Test.

                                    <h4>UPSC CSE REQUIRES A DIFFERENT STRATEGY </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Shelly Crane has aptly said that “It doesn't matter who you were or what you've done in the past. The only thing that matters is who you are right now”. Every year, numerous aspirants from different academic backgrounds sit for the most challenging exam with the hope of becoming an IAS officer and serving their country. Coming out of their academics and starting preparation for the UPSC CSE Exam may sometimes be a challenging task. This is because unlike academics, where you only aim for mugging a few topics and jotting them in the exam, UPSC requires a different strategy. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While preparing for the Civil Services Exam, a candidate is expected to know numerous aspects which are connected to our day-to-day life. Since the work profile of a civil servant is to act as an efficient administrator and also maintain law and order, UPSC expects the aspirant to be well versed in the practical topics which are related to the happenings around us. In addition to this, the syllabus for UPSC CSE incorporates in itself static as well as dynamic aspects, which anyone with a systematic and focused preparation will be able to ace. <strong> Just remember, the UPSC CSE Exam is not about scoring the 90 %. You may score as high as 50% and still turn out to be a topper. </strong>
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>HOW TO PREPARE LAW OPTIONAL</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Most aspirants prepare their optional subject first and then start preparing for their General Studies Papers. Jasbir Singh Bajaj Sir also advises this strategy to the aspirants because once the aspirant has completed his optional subject, he can easily focus on his GS papers making sure that the optional subject is not a hindrance to his GS preparation. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But what if we tell you that there is a subject that instead of being a hindrance, will supplement your GS preparation. Yes, you heard it correctly, Law Optional is one such subject. The General Studies paper has taken out bits and pieces from many optional subjects, but the Law Optional syllabus has a considerable part that overlaps with General Studies, both Prelims, and Mains Exam.

                                        Enjoying the highest Success Rate, amongst the most popular Optional subjects, Law Optional stands at a very high pedestal, which means that if an aspirant opts for Law, there is an exorbitant chance that he will come out successfully and get into his desired service. When we talk about Success Rate, consistency is the key and we can see that the law optional has been consistent for the past seven years as mentioned in the Annual UPSC Report, given below:

                                        To understand how an aspirant should prepare his strategy for the Optional subject, they should analyze and understand the plan of action of those who have successfully aced the examination with Law as their Optional.

                                        How about having a mentor, who is adorned with proper qualifications, has burnt the midnight oil, went through the rigors of the entire process, and came out with roaring success?

                                        Aspirants having a law background have already covered numerous laws during their academics and thus they are already versed with the academic part of law. However, as we have already discussed that the strategy required for the preparation of law optional is different from our academics, the aspirants who have already studied law in their college life are now expected to apply such knowledge in accordance with the need of the UPSC exam. The pattern of questions asked in law optional subject tilts towards contemporary legal issues and therefore it is expected from the aspirant to apply their legal knowledge in a restrictive manner keeping in mind the requirement of the exam. 
                                    </p>

                                        In UPSC Law Optional Examination, the study of various legal provisions, case laws, authorities, judgments, etc. is done in a different way than that of the college examinations, but cramming all the Laws in both the scenarios is neither advisable nor feasible. Also, in college, more focus is generally on filling up the sheets; whereas, in Law Optional, your emphasis must be on the precise and crisp writing of the answer within the prescribed word limit. Therefore, in order to start your preparation journey, you need to keep the following points in mind: 
                                        <br>

                                                Detailed analysis of each and every heading and sub-heading of the syllabus of Law Optional is the first step towards the beginning of the preparation phase. It is always advisable that you paste the syllabus on the places of your sight, so that whenever you will move around that place, in some way or the other you will end up reading the syllabus time and again, which will further lead to stimulation of your mind. This will not let you lose your focus and you will always stay in the broad contours of the areas of the syllabus created by you, in your memory.

                                               It's time to go back to the basics. You need to analyze the syllabus of your college as well as the syllabus of your Law Optional together. After analyzing both the syllabi, you will find that the maximum portion, which formulates the syllabus of Law Optional was taught to you, during your Law Degree. There is an overlapping of almost 70 to 80 percent of the syllabus. So, if you have studied diligently during your LL.B. course with due attention, this means that you have crossed the first milestone. After having the basic knowledge of the subjects to be studied in the Law Optional, now all you need is to devise a plan in accordance with the UPSC Examination Pattern. It is pertinent to note that even if there is an overlap in the syllabus, the approach toward answering the questions is way apart. Unlike college exams, UPSC Examination requires crisp and precise answers which follow the word limit as prescribed against each question. Therefore, here instead of mugging up and jotting down whatever you remember is not the requirement. Instead, you must create a mental synopsis of your answer and then write it within the word limit provided.

                                       At the outset, we must make it clear that having a law degree is not at all necessary for someone to ace law optional subject, after all, law is a very practical subject that relates to everyday happenings. Any aspirant who is preparing for their General Studies Paper is already well versed with contemporary issues and therefore while preparing for law optional there won't be any need of reading something special. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Most of the topics under Law Optional are already covered under GS Paper due to the huge overlapping in them and thus even if the aspirant is not from a legal background, he will be able to understand and grasp the concepts very easily. As we have discussed earlier, the Indian Polity portion of General Studies Paper-II comprises the Constitutional Law. It is overlapping with a significant portion of Law Optional as well. Therefore, commencing the preparation for Law Optional with the Supreme Law of the land i.e., Constitutional Law becomes imperative. This will help you big time in the requisite understanding of the significant basic legal terms and building a premise for a better understanding of other Laws such as Administrative Laws, Law of Crimes, Law of Contract, Environmental Law, Law of Competition etc.

                                        It is a myth among aspirants that law optional is very tough and if you are not from a law background, you won’t be able to comprehend it. This is not true at all, and there are many people who aced at law optional without having any law degree, the biggest example being Jasbir Singh Bajaj Sir, who because of his interest and enthusiasm in law opted for law as his optional and ended up becoming an IAS Officer. 
                                        <br>
                                        If we talk about the strategy of approaching the Law Optional for the non-law graduates, it is somewhat different to a certain extent. When an aspirant has an interest in law, a lack of a LL.B. Degree won’t become a hindrance for him and therefore Jasbir Singh Bajaj Sir has recommended a different strategy for approaching the examination for those lacking a law degree.
                                        <br>
                                        According to him, in order to approach the examination, an aspirant must take into consideration the following points:
                                        <br>
                                        <ol class="ml-5" type="I">

                                                <br>
                                                After the basic understanding of the laws, it becomes imperative to understand what type of questions are asked by the Union Public Service Commission in the examination. A deep perusal of the past year’s question papers becomes imperative at this juncture. The aspirants are hereby required to make a separate copy or a register and section it accordingly in different heads of the laws which are asked as per the syllabus, furnished by the UPSC. The concepts derived from the questions asked in the past years are required to be incorporated into the register along with the number of times they have been repeated.

                                               Detailed analysis of each and every heading and sub-heading of the syllabus of Law Optional is the second step. While perusing the syllabus, you will understand that there are some of the topics- which are new and you may also have never heard of them. There is no requirement of being anxious about this fact as such. You just need to read the past year’s papers in detail, corresponding it with the course material and books, that you have chosen for yourself, after detailed research.
However, it is always advisable that you paste the syllabus on the places of your sight, so that whenever you will move around that place, in some way or the other you will end up reading the syllabus time and again, which will further lead to memorization of all the significant portions of the syllabus. This will not let you lose your focus and you will always stay in the broad contours of the areas of the syllabus created by you in your mind. We advise you to strictly adhere to the syllabus as furnished by UPSC from time to time.

Instead, law optional requires a thorough understanding of the important concepts which are provided in the law optional syllabus. Your knowledge of suitable case laws will not help you in succeeding if you are not able to apply your knowledge in accordance with the question asked in the examination. And for doing this, all you need to do is practice answer writing. For further elaboration on this point, let’s move on to the strategy which is common to both the aspirants, who may or may not possess a law degree.

In the Mains examination, the space provided to the aspirant is fixed in the answer booklet, and therefore it is imperative for the aspirant to structure their answer in accordance with the need of the question. We advise that for 20 marker questions, about 250 words; for 15 marker questions, about 200 words and lastly for 10 marker questions, about 150 words must be written by the aspirant to fetch maximum marks. Thus, the aspirant is advised to practice answer writing on a daily basis.

Hard work is the key. Constant revision of the Articles, Sections, Concepts of law, Case laws, etc. is also important in order to memorize them and have a better understanding.
