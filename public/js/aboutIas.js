You just need to read the past year’s papers in detail, corresponding it with the course material and books, that you have chosen for yourself, after detailed research.\nHowever, it is always advisable that you paste the syllabus on the places of your sight, so that whenever you will move around that place, in some way or the other you will end up reading the syllabus time and again, which will further lead to memorization of all the significant portions of the syllabus. This will not let you lose your focus and you will always stay in the broad contours of the areas of the syllabus created by you in your mind. We advise you to strictly adhere to the syllabus as furnished by UPSC from time to time. \n \n                                            ")]),t._v(" "),a("li",[a("strong",[t._v("\n                                                    Start your preparation process:\n                                                ")]),t._v(" "),a("br"),t._v("\n                                                When you have decided that you want to finally go with the law as your optional, also have decided as to from which study material you want to study, now it’s time to start your preparation.\n                                                "),a("br"),t._v("\n                                                Make a timetable and follow it with discipline, keeping in mind the need and requirements of the syllabus. \n                                                "),a("br"),t._v("\n                                                While preparing for law optional, the aspirant must keep in mind that law is not about mugging up some legal provisions or case laws. Instead, law optional requires a thorough understanding of the important concepts which are provided in the law optional syllabus. Your knowledge of suitable case laws will not help you in succeeding if you are not able to apply your knowledge in accordance with the question asked in the examination. And for doing this, all you need to do is practice answer writing.

In the Mains examination, the space provided to the aspirant is fixed in the answer booklet, and therefore it is imperative for the aspirant to structure their answer in accordance with the need of the question. We advise that for 20 marker questions, about 250 words; for 15 marker questions, about 200 words and lastly for 10 marker questions, about 150 words must be written by the aspirant to fetch maximum marks. Thus, the aspirant is advised to practice answer writing on a daily basis.  \n                                            ")]),t._v(" "),a("li",[a("strong",[t._v("\n                                                    REVISE!
